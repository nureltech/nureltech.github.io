                    Fran gasped as she surveyed the devastation that was Lathmor Valley. The land was a wasteland,
                    scoured
                    by
                    fire and great gouges torn from the ground. This morning it had been a peaceful, lush, green vale,
                    where
                    sheep grazed, tended by shepherds. Now it was a blasted place, a ruin, empty of all living things.
                    Except
                    for Fran of course.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Terrified, she wiped the sweat from her brow and through her short curly hair, tears starting to
                    form in
                    her
                    large brown eyes. The golden brown skin of her face and hands was smudged with black, sooty marks
                    from
                    the
                    smoke billowing from the scene around her. “Tarm! Tarm! Oh, by all the Gods! Look! Look what it’s
                    done!”
                    she
                    cried, calling for her best friend Tarm to come around the rock face and witness the destruction.

                    Tarm was a broad, strong looking boy of eleven years, the same age as Fran but his appearance was in
                    sharp
                    contrast. He was pale skinned, with a shock of long, red hair, hanging down to his shoulders.
                    Although
                    they
                    looked so different, at heart they were similar, with the same passions and interests. They had
                    become
                    close
                    friends in their home settlement of Waystone Village as soon as they learnt of each other's keen
                    interest in
                    dragon lore.

                <p>
                    Tarm’s eyes widened in shock as he took in the scene. “No! No way!” he stuttered in shock. “It’s a
                    dragon!
                    Must be, and a big one too! Gods…” There were no more words to say. The blood drained from his face
                    and
                    his
                    eyes scanned the horizon, looking for any sign of the beast or beasts that had caused this. “Let’s
                    get home… Now!” he shouted at Fran, before they turned and ran as fast as their legs could carry
                    them.

                    Dragons were once regular visitors to the Misty Isles, seeking shelter in the lofty peaks of the
                    islands
                    and
                    food from the fertile valleys tended by the people of the isles, Fran and Tarm’s people. In recent
                    years,
                    their visits were less frequent and their numbers fewer. Over the years, people had devised a way to
                    coexist
                    with the dragons. The strongest of the folk had the honour of seeking out a dragon to tame, setting
                    out
                    to
                    the peaks on a quest to bring glory to their family name. Certain families had by now become known
                    as
                    dragon
                    tamers, Tarm’s family was high among them. Fran’s family, on the other hand, were farmers and had no
                    expectations that she should go down the path of the dragon-tamer. In fact her parents had forbidden
                    her
                    from pursuing her interest, saying she must follow her family tradition of working the land.
