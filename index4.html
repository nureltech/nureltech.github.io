                    As they climbed higher into the air, Fran twisted to look back at the                     pursuers coming upon the cave. A volley of arrows whistled close by                       but thankfully missed both her and the dragon. She just had time to                       glimpse Tarm, staring at her open-mouthed. She saw him whirl around                       and shout a warning, appearing to stop the archers from loosing                           another volley of arrows into the air. “Thank you Tarm.” she thought                      to herself.

                    “Are they your enemies? Should I return and destroy them? It would be                     quite easy for me.” the voice in her head spoke out suddenly.
                  <br><br>
                    “No, no! They are my people! Don’t hurt them, they think you aim to                       destroy them.” she quickly responded, desperately hoping the dragon                       would heed her plea.
                  <br><br>
                    “Very well little one, I have no wish to make more war,” the dragon                       said in a gentle tone. “We are safe now.”

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>

                    Fran realised that they were in the cloud. She could not see further                      than a few feet ahead and moisture clung to her as they flew up and                       up. The wind filled her ears with a rushing sound as they climbed and                     then, quite suddenly, they burst through the cloud into a clear sky.                      The sun beamed down on them as they flew over what looked like a sea                      of cotton wool

            <div>
                <span class="star_separator">&#10021;</span>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    “It’s so beautiful!” she thought to herself, marvelling at this sight                      that none of her people had witnessed before.
                    <br><br>
                    “The sky is as much my home as the earth,” said Aryzath. “We travel                       now to a sacred place that few of your kind know of.”
                    <br><br>
                    “What kind of place? Where is it?” asked Fran, suddenly afraid of                         where this creature might take her.
                    <br><br>
                    “Have no fear, little friend, you will soon see all” the dragon’s                          voice soothed her.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class="star_separator">&#10021;</span>

            <div>
                <p>
                    They flew on for the rest of the day. Fran began to grow tired and                         every now and then she felt her grip on the dragon’s scaly neck                           slip. If she fell asleep she was sure she would fall to her death.                        As this thought settled uncomfortably in her mind, something caught                       her eye on the horizon. As Aryzath beat his wings, they drew closer                       to what appeared to be a green object in the sky. Soon it loomed                          larger and Fran could make out the details of it. It was some kind                        of vast island, floating in the sky!

            <div>
                <p>
                    “This cannot be! How can this be?” her mind reeled with wonder at the                     sight. She could see green hills rolling into the distant centre of                       the island, where lofty peaks could be seen. Rivers and streams ran                       down from the heights. It looked like a paradise. What was this                           place, floating so impossibly in the sky?

          <div>
                <span class="star_separator">&#10021;</span>

          <div>
                <p>
                   As they gently touched down, she slid from her place on the dragon and                    touched the fragrant grass beneath her feet. This was not possible.                       It could not be true. 
                </p>

                   “This is the sanctuary place. Forbidden to most. Only a special few                       may tread here. For thousands of years it was home to the bonded                          pairs. Dragon and human, joined together in a mystical bond. No others                    can tread here lest the gods sweep them away,” Aryzath pawed the                          ground with his great claw. “I myself have never trodden the ground                       here for fear of that. None of my kind have in living memory”. His                        eyes stared into hers, willing her to realise what was happening                          between them. 
                </p>
            </div>
          <div>

          <div>
                <p>
                  As Fran stared at the dragon, she knew that this was the start of                         something she had unknowingly wanted all of her short life. She was now                   bonded with this dragon and the possibilities began to fill her mind.                     She could see the future that awaited them both, a life of wonder and                     adventure. There were old tales amongst her people of the dragon                          riders, but these were considered to be myth, fairy tales made up for                     the entertainment of children. Now she knew that to be a lie. Like all                    myths, this one had a grain of truth. She was now a dragon rider.
