                    Fran slowly crept out of the house, trying hard not to make a sound. It was an hour past midnight
                    and everyone was asleep. She knew if she was caught, she would be in serious trouble, but she could
                    not stop herself. The village elders had sent the dragon tamers out to pursue the dragon, or
                    dragons, that had devastated the land two days ago, Tarm among them. Fran had begged to go with
                    them, after all she had been the one to discover the dragon signs! She knew everything there was to
                    know about dragons too. Why shouldn’t she be allowed to go along? With all her knowledge, she could
                    help. Heck, she even knew more than Tarm!
                </p>

                    The elders refused. She was of the farm people, her place was here in the village. Here was where
                    she could help the most, tending the goats and chickens her family raised. She had burned with
                    indignation at this. That night she had wept hot tears into her pillow. She thought no one knew or
                    cared about her feelings but she was wrong. Someone knew, someone cared. A keen pair of eyes had
                    watched her flee from the village hall in a storm of tears. Those eyes belonged to the wise woman.
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The wise woman was the oldest person in the village but she was an active member of the community
                    and many people sought her counsel. She had come to Fran that night and told her that she knew of
                    her pain. Her eyes had twinkled when she whispered to Fran, “Child, you get but one life. Do not
                    waste it. Follow your heart. Else all your dreams will disappear into the dust!” That was when Fran
                    hatched her plan.
                </p>

                    Fran had covered many miles before she was missed at breakfast and the alarm was raised. She carried
                    a small bag with food and a little water in a leather flask. The most important object she carried
                    with her was her notebook, containing all the dragon lore she had accumulated over her short life.
                    That was her most prized possession and it was what she relied on now to help her in her quest. She
                    would find this dragon and she would be the one to subdue it!
                </p>

                    These thoughts were in her head as she climbed the steep slopes of Snowytop Mountain, many miles
                    from Waystone Village. She was getting tired, her hands were bloody from scrabbling at the rocks to
                    pull herself higher up the peak. It was then that she heard it. It seemed like a whisper at first,
                    barely audible. Though she couldn’t understand it, she felt the emotion in it. It spoke to her of
                    fear and a deep, powerful loneliness.
                </p>

                    She followed the sound as best she could. It seemed to get louder and clearer as she ascended. The
                    sense of loneliness and fear increased, making her heart quail at the intensity of it. She was
                    nearing the highest slopes of the mountain, and she was breathing hard. She wondered how much
                    further she could go. That was when she saw the cave.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class="star_separator">&#10021;</span>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The cave was beneath a rocky outcrop which shaded the interior, making it dark and gloomy. She
                    stared, hard at the darkness. Could she see something in there? Something moving? She approached
                    slowly, using all the stealth she could muster, her heart thudding in her chest. “What am I doing?”
                    she thought to herself, “I’m going to get myself killed!” She stopped in her tracks, pondering her
                    next move.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Why ever would you think that, young one?” said a strange voice, loud and booming inside her head.
                    As she stood there outside the cave, frozen to the spot with fear, a ray of light from the rising
                    sun illuminated enough of the cave for her to see what lay within. There, curled around its own
                    tail, was a dragon. It was large and powerful looking, as big as the village elders longhouse. Two
                    large, yellow, baleful eyes stared at her as her legs buckled beneath her and she sat down in a heap
                    on the bare earth beneath her. It was then that she realised that the sound she could hear was the
                    same as the voice she had just heard and not only that, she had not heard it with her ears, the
                    voice and the strange sound was in her mind! Something very strange and unexpected was happening at
                    this very moment and she was both terrified and confused. What was this strange, powerful creature
                    about to do?
