                    The next few hours passed like a dream for Fran. Before she knew what she was doing, she was
                    kneeling alongside the great creature, staring into its eyes. Fran listened with her mind as the
                    dragon told her his story as if they were old friends.

                    His name was Aryzath and was one of the last of his clan. His homeland was far to the west and his
                    folk had lived there for thousands of years until an enemy dragon clan attacked their home in great
                    numbers. His folk were caught unprepared and were massacred by the enemy dragons. All the young
                    dragons and the elders were killed. The warriors were defeated and scattered to the winds.

                    Aryzath was a captain of the warrior breed of his clan and fought until he was too wounded to
                    continue. He expected to be killed by his enemies but they simply left him for dead, bleeding in the
                    ocean. He drifted on the seas until he regained consciousness and found himself here at the Misty
                    Isles. Confused and disorientated, he had laid waste to the land in his rage, searching for his
                    enemies until he realised he was not in his homelands any longer. Exhausted by the effort and his
                    wounds, he had retreated to this cave to recover and consider his next path.

                    “I have no honour now, young one” he said. “I am defeated, lost, and without a home or folk to call
                    my own. If you have come to slay me, then I pray you do so quickly. I am wretched now and do not
                    deserve life.” Aryzath’s eyes closed and a great sighing breath left his body. “I have no desire to
                    harm you or your people. My ears are still keen though, and I hear others of your folk approaching
                    from the East. I know what humans do to my kind. They kill or enslave. I know not what fate awaits
                    me with them. Death is the most preferable of the two. Please young one, use your weapon now.”

                    “I carry no weapons, dragon,” said Fran quietly. “Although my people will be armed. They have come
                    to tame you or destroy you if you cannot be taken.” Fran was deep in thought. She should take this
                    dragon and try to capture or destroy him like the rest of her folk. Is this not what she had wanted
                    when she set out on this journey? Something in her heart had changed after hearing this dragon’s
                    tale. Somehow a shift had happened and now she could not face the idea of this magnificent creature
                    being captured or destroyed. She made her decision.

            <div>
                <p>
                    “Come, dragon. We must flee now or you will indeed face death. I do not think you will allow
                    yourself to be captured and that means certain death for you. My heart tells me that your fate is
                    not to die here. There is still more for you to do.” The dragon stirred at these words. “There is
                    something you should know, girl. Humans are rarely able to converse with dragonkind. This is a
                    remarkable thing. This means you are a dragon-friend, a special type of human blessed by the Gods of
                    dragons and humans both. It was no mere chance that we met here.”
                </p>

            <div>
                <span class="star_separator">&#10059;</span>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The dragon roused himself and moved gracefully out of the cave. “Come then. If we are to go, you
                    must accompany me. Seat yourself upon my back, just where the neck becomes the shoulder. There you
                    will be safe and comfortable.” Fran, taken aback by this information, opened her eyes wide and
                    stared at the dragon for a moment before quickly gathering her things. Very carefully she got into
                    position on the dragon’s shoulders. Aryzath turned his head to look at her for a moment before
                    snorting and launching himself high into the air. His body plunged over the side of the mountain
                    dropping like a stone until his wings unfurled and he beat the air strongly, rising rapidly towards
                    the clouds. Fran held on to his neck tightly, trying not to scream with fear.
